## How to play

## Characters

The game has 2 main characters:

1. The player uses a helicopter that fires powerful lasers
2. The villains are using fighter jets with heavy bombs

The main task of a player is to fire at as many jets and bombs as possible to score higher, while avoiding collisions with the jets or their bombs.

### Game Control

To play the game, the arrow keys highlighted below as well as a space bar will be very crucial.

- Once the game loads, Fill in your name and then click the "Play" Button
- Please note that a name should be more than 2 characters
- Use arrow keys to control your helicopter and escape from jets as well as their bombs.
- Use the space bar to shoot down jets and their bombs. The more jets and bombs you shoot, the higher the score.
- Please also note that shooting down jets makes you score much higher.
